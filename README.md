knowledge of sensor fusion and localization

# sensor fusion
  The 3 types of Sensor Fusion classification(I - Sensor Fusion by Abstraction Level, II - Sensor Fusion by Centralization Level, III - Sensor Fusion by Competition Level), and the 9 types of Sensor Fusion algorithms.[Algorthm review](https://www.thinkautonomous.ai/blog/9-types-of-sensor-fusion-algorithms/)

# localization
  The task of localization is split into three components that are the Road Level Localization (RLL), Ego-Lane Level Localization (ELL) and Lane-Level Localization (LLL).
