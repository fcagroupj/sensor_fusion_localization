# sensor fusion
  The 3 types of Sensor Fusion classification(I - Sensor Fusion by Abstraction Level, II - Sensor Fusion by Centralization Level, III - Sensor Fusion by Competition Level), and the 9 types of Sensor Fusion algorithms.[Algorthm review](https://www.thinkautonomous.ai/blog/9-types-of-sensor-fusion-algorithms/)

# localization
  The task of localization is split into three components that are the Road Level Localization (RLL), Ego-Lane Level Localization (ELL) and Lane-Level Localization (LLL). [Algorithm review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8749843/#:~:text=Lane-Level%20Localization%20%28LLL%29%3A%20The%20position%20of%20the%20host,%28OSM%29%2C%20Waze%29%20are%20used%20to%20perform%20this%20task.)
